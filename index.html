      WELCOME to Speech Processing Laboratory (SPL)
    </p>
    <p>
      SPL is one of the research laboratories of Computer Engineering Department
      of Sharif University Of Technology. The main area of the research in this
      Lab is Digital Signal Processing, specially Speech signals. Speech
      Recognition is the major field of activity for this group and a speech
      recognition engine including the latest and successful algorithms is
      developed. This engine is customized for Persian language including
      Persian language models (Statistical and Grammatical) and the first
      version is released as NEVISA, the most robust and accurate Persian
      dictation system. SPL also developed NEWSHA (T-NEVISA), the high accurate
      Persian telephony speech recognition including command and digit
      recognition. Some of derived products from these engines are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parsia: Persian voice translator</li>
      <li>NevisYar: Persian intelligent typing</li>
      <li>Digit and command recognition</li>
      <li>Telephony doctor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other speech-based solutions are available on the lab's partner ASR Gooyesh Pardaz Co. web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about the projects of this group follow Projects
      page. Experts in this group are working on various digital speech related
      research areas such as Speech Enhancement and Speech Synthesis. The
      summary of the fields of activity of this group are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Speech Processing</li>
      <li>Robust Speech Recognition</li>
      <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Currently this group has more than 15 members which are Ph.D and M.S.
      students or M.S. graduated, in supervision of Dr. Hossein Sameti.
      More information about the members can be found in People page.
